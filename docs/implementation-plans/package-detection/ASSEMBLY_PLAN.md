# Package Assembly Implementation Plan

> **Status**: 🟢 Historical rollout record — the assembly rollout tracked here is complete
> **Current contract owner**: [`../../ARCHITECTURE.md`](../../ARCHITECTURE.md) for current assembly behavior and [`../../HOW_TO_ADD_A_PARSER.md`](../../HOW_TO_ADD_A_PARSER.md) for datasource/assembly guidance for new parsers
> **Historical priority**: P0 - Critical for Package Detection Completeness
> **Dependencies at implementation time**: PARSER_PLAN.md (parsers had to exist first)

## Overview

This file is retained as a dated assembly rollout record. Phase breakdowns, commit references, and dated status snapshots below are historical evidence, not the canonical source for current assembly behavior.

Package assembly merges related manifest files into logical packages. For example, `package.json` + `package-lock.json` + `yarn.lock` are assembled into a single Package with complete dependency information.

### Scope

**Covers**: Sibling file merging, nested file merging, directory-based assembly, archive extraction assembly, UID generation, top-level `packages[]` and `dependencies[]` output arrays, `for_packages` linking.

**Does NOT cover**: Package consolidation (see `../post-processing/CONSOLIDATION_PLAN.md`), package summarization (see `../post-processing/SUMMARIZATION_PLAN.md`).

## Historical Implementation State (Accurate as of Feb 11, 2026)

### ✅ Phase 1: Sibling-Merge — COMPLETE (Feb 10, 2026)

Generic sibling-merge framework + 8 ecosystems.

- Assembly framework with sibling-merge pattern
- Assembly phase in scanner pipeline
- Top-level `packages[]` and `dependencies[]` arrays in JSON output
- UID generation logic with UUID v4
- `--no-assemble` CLI flag
- 8 ecosystem assemblers: npm, cargo, cocoapods, composer, golang, pubspec, chef, conan
- Golden tests for 4 ecosystems (npm, cargo, go, composer)

**Key commits**: 0d22687 (assembly implementation), fce212c (golden tests), 8cfc855 (`--no-assemble` flag)

### ✅ Phase 2: Nested Sibling-Merge — COMPLETE (Feb 10, 2026)

Nested directory patterns for ecosystems where related files live in different subdirectories.

- Maven nested sibling-merge (pom.xml + META-INF/MANIFEST.MF)
- Debian source nested merge (debian/ directory)
- Generalized `find_package_root()` for nested anchor directories
- Maven golden test passing

**Implementation**: `src/assembly/nested_merge.rs`

### ✅ Phase 3: Comprehensive Assembler Configs — COMPLETE (Feb 10, 2026)

Every parser's datasource_id now has an assembly config.

- `AssemblyMode` enum: `SiblingMerge` + `OnePerPackageData`
- `OnePerPackageData` mode for database files (Alpine, RPM, Debian installed DBs)
- 26 assembler configs covering all parser ecosystems
- 10 datasource IDs explicitly documented as intentionally unassembled
- All phantom datasource IDs fixed

**Key commits**: 8f2465e (Alpine/RPM parser fixes), 70335a5 (OnePerPackageData), 34c4f37 (Debian source nested merge)

### ✅ Phase 4a: npm Workspace Assembly — COMPLETE (Feb 11, 2026)

npm/pnpm workspace support: creates separate Package objects per workspace member, resolves `workspace:*` version references, and properly assigns shared resources.

- Workspace root detection (package.json `workspaces` field + pnpm-workspace.yaml)
- Member discovery via three-tier glob matching (simple paths, single-star, complex globs)
- Member Package creation with proper UID assignment
- Root dependency hoisting (workspace-level, or to root if pnpm)
- `workspace:*`, `workspace:^`, `workspace:~` version resolution against member versions
- `for_packages` assignment (member files → member UID; shared files → all members or root only)
- pnpm variant handling (non-private root kept as separate package)
- Sibling-merge cleanup (removes duplicate packages created by earlier assembly phases)
- Exclusion pattern support for workspace member discovery

**Implementation**: `src/assembly/workspace_merge.rs` (859 lines)
**Key commits**: 55cac94 (workspace assembly implementation)

### ✅ Phase 4b: File Reference Resolution — COMPLETE (Feb 11, 2026)

Resolves `file_references` from package database entries (RPM/Alpine/Debian) against scanned files on disk.

- Database path detection for Alpine (`lib/apk/db/installed`), RPM (BDB/NDB/SQLite), Debian (`var/lib/dpkg/status`), Debian Distroless
- Root path computation from datafile path (e.g., `rootfs/var/lib/rpm/Packages` → root `rootfs/`)
- File reference resolution via HashMap index (O(1) lookup per reference)
- `for_packages` assignment on matched files
- Missing reference tracking in `package.extra_data["missing_file_references"]`
- RPM namespace resolution from `etc/os-release` or `usr/lib/os-release`
- Namespace propagation to package dependencies
- Per-package file reference collection (purl-matched, not all-packages-in-file)

**Implementation**: `src/assembly/file_ref_resolve.rs` (750 lines)

**Bug fixes during implementation:**

- Fixed Alpine parser case-sensitivity bug: `T:`/`t:` and `C:`/`c:` keys were colliding due to rfc822 parser lowercasing all keys. Replaced with Alpine-specific case-sensitive parser.
- Fixed file reference collection: was returning ALL file_references from a DB file for every package instead of only the matching package's references (purl-based filtering).

### ✅ Phase 4c: Cargo Workspace Assembly — COMPLETE (Feb 11, 2026)

Cargo workspace support: creates separate Package objects per workspace member, resolves `[workspace.package]` inheritance and `workspace = true` dependencies.

- Workspace root detection via `[workspace]` section with `members` array
- Member discovery via glob pattern matching (simple paths, single-star, complex globs)
- Workspace metadata extraction (`[workspace.package]` and `[workspace.dependencies]`)
- Full field inheritance: version, license, homepage, repository, categories, edition, rust-version, authors
- Dependency version resolution for `{ workspace = true }` dependencies
- Member Package creation with inherited metadata
- Root package removal (workspace manifests don't publish)
- `for_packages` assignment (member files → member UID; shared files → all members; `target/` excluded)

**Implementation**: `src/assembly/cargo_workspace_merge.rs` (524 lines)

### Golden Tests (8 total)

## Completed — No Remaining Work

All package assembly features are implemented. The assembly pipeline is feature-complete.

### ✅ Archive Extraction Assembly — OUT OF SCOPE

Archive extraction is **permanently out of scope** for Provenant. The Python ScanCode ecosystem uses a separate tool called [ExtractCode](https://github.com/aboutcode-org/extractcode) that users run as a preprocessing step before scanning. ScanCode's core pipeline never extracts archives — it only scans pre-existing files on disk.

Users of Provenant can use ExtractCode before scanning, just like with Python ScanCode. A future `extractcode-provenant` tool could be created as a separate project, but that is entirely outside the scope of Provenant.

**Note**: Our `.deb` and `.apk` parsers can read metadata directly from archive files without extraction, which is an improvement over Python (documented in `docs/improvements/debian-parser.md` and `docs/improvements/alpine-parser.md`). This means users get package metadata from these archives without needing ExtractCode at all.

### ExtractCode Naming Convention Compatibility

When ExtractCode extracts archives, it creates directories with a `-extract` suffix (e.g., `control.tar.gz-extract/`, `data.gz-extract/`, `metadata.gz-extract/`). For Provenant to be a drop-in replacement, parsers must also match these `-extract` paths.

**Current coverage**:

| ExtractCode Pattern                        | Python Parser                            | Rust Status                      |
| ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `*/control.tar.{gz,xz}-extract/control`    | `DebianControlFileInExtractedDebHandler` | ✅ Supported                     |
| `*/control.tar.{gz,xz}-extract/md5sums`    | `DebianMd5sumsInDebHandler`              | ✅ Supported                     |
| `*/metadata.gz-extract`                    | `GemArchiveHandler`                      | ✅ Supported                     |
| `*/data.gz-extract/*.gemspec`              | `GemspecInExtractedGemHandler`           | ✅ Supported                     |
| `*/data.gz-extract/Gemfile`                | `GemfileInExtractedGemHandler`           | ✅ Supported                     |
| `*/data.gz-extract/Gemfile.lock`           | `GemfileLockInExtractedGemHandler`       | ✅ Supported                     |
| `info/recipe.tar-extract/recipe/meta.yaml` | `CondaMetaYamlHandler`                   | ✅ Supported (by filename match) |

### What Python's "Consolidation" Does (NOT Assembly)

Consolidation is a **separate post-scan plugin** (`plugin_consolidate.py`), not part of assembly. In Provenant it is currently an intentionally deferred compatibility feature. Upstream consolidation:

- Groups resources by package or copyright holder
- Creates `ConsolidatedPackage` and `ConsolidatedComponent` objects
- Combines declared licenses with discovered licenses in files
- This is documented separately in [CONSOLIDATION_PLAN.md](../post-processing/CONSOLIDATION_PLAN.md) as an intentionally deferred compatibility feature

## Architecture Reference

### Data Structures

```rust
// PackageData fields for assembly
pub package_uid: Option<String>,     // PURL + UUID qualifier
pub dependency_uid: Option<String>,  // PURL + UUID qualifier
pub for_package_uid: Option<String>, // Links dependency to owning package

// Package struct (assembled result)
pub struct Package {
    pub package_data: PackageData,
    pub datafile_paths: Vec<String>,   // Which files define this package
    pub datasource_ids: Vec<String>,   // Which parsers extracted data
}
```

### Assembly Pipeline

```text
File Enumeration → Parser Selection → Package Extraction → Assembly Phase → JSON Output
                                                               ↓
                                                     Phase 1: Group by directory → merge siblings
                                                     Phase 2: Find nested patterns → merge into root
                                                     Phase 3: OnePerPackageData → each file's packages
                                                     Phase 4: File ref resolution → for_packages linking
                                                     Phase 5: Workspace assembly → per-member packages
```

### Assembly Modes

| Mode                | Behavior                                          | Used By                                            |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `SiblingMerge`      | Merge related files in same/nested directory      | npm, cargo, maven, golang, etc. (23 configs)       |
| `OnePerPackageData` | Each file becomes independent packages            | Alpine DB, RPM DB, Debian installed DB (3 configs) |
| File ref resolution | Resolve file_references → `for_packages` linking  | Alpine, RPM, Debian installed DBs                  |
| Workspace assembly  | Post-processing pass creating per-member packages | npm/pnpm workspaces, Cargo workspaces              |

### Performance Optimizations

- **Static assembler lookup via `LazyLock`**: The `ASSEMBLER_LOOKUP` HashMap (mapping every `DatasourceId` to its config key) is built once on first access using `std::sync::LazyLock` and stored as a `static`. Previously, this map was rebuilt on every `assemble()` call. Now there is zero allocation per call and O(1) config lookup by `DatasourceId`. See `src/assembly/mod.rs` lines 18–32.
